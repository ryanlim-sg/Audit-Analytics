## Data Analysis Case Study

The audit team is currently onsite for an audit of the interactions with Healthcare Practitioners (HCPs) in the China affiliate of Company X. The auditees in the country have provided the following T&E expenses for the organization for the full year of 2020:
1.	T&E expenses reports from the T&E system
a.	TnE_Claims_Report_2020.csv
b.	TnE_ClaimAttendees_Report_2020.csv

For this case study, please provide your answers to the following question:
1.	Using the T&E reports provided, you are to perform the overall T&E spend analysis on HCPs. Please present this analysis in a tabular report or as visualizations within a dashboard. For each report or visualization prepared, please provide details on the dimension and measures chosen, and explain why you think it will be useful to audit team.

2.	A further list of T&E rules regarding HCPs has been provided by the auditees in the following file:
a.	TnE_ExpenseClaimRules.xlsx

Based on these T&E rules, you are to perform the analysis to identify the records with exceptions to each rule. Please provided exceptions in a tabular report. For each report, please provide details on the filters performed, and why they were chosen.

The following section provides additional contextual information for the Case Study:
Company X mainly engages HCPs through medical events. These events are managed within the Event Management System. The users in the Marketing or Sales department will raise a request for an event in the system, and provide the event details such as the event budget, the list of HCP attendees, and list of HCP approved speakers. Once the event request is approved, an internal order will be automatically created in the regional accounting system to track expenses incurred for the event. Certain departments may also manage their events outside the event management system. For these departments, approval is obtained offline, and the internal order will be manually created by the finance department.

HCPs are invited either as event speakers or attendees. Approval will need to be obtained before they can be invited to an event. If an HCP is invited as a speaker for an event, a service agreement will be drafted stating the scope of services they are to provide, and the fees they will be paid. These fees will be paid directly to the HCP. All HCP speakers will need to be validated by Company X before they can be engaged. Once validated, they will be assigned a speaker level depending on their qualifications and years of experience. The amount of fees paid will depend on the HCPâ€™s speaker level. HCPs can also be engaged either as attendees for events, or through daily visits by Sales reps. In this case, there are no direct payments to the HCP, and any hospitality (eg. meals, refreshments) provided to HCPs are claimed by the employee through the T&E system.
